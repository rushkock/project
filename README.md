### paragraph summary of the application goals at the top.

## Problem statement
There is a lot of data and information about different mental health diseases. There are many papers describing prevalence rates of mental disorders (Anderson, Freedland, Clouse, & Lustman, 2001; Nock, et al., 2008). However, based on my experience these papers use tables instead of visualizations to show the data. Moreover, if visualizations are used it is complicated and academic as in the case with the paper by Nock and colleagues (2008). This website aims to provide clear visualizations for academics and non-academics alike who are interested is prevalence rates of mental disorders in the united states.

## Solution
I will show the prevalence in the united states of mental disorders, serious mental disorders, depression and suicidal thoughts in 4 different graphs in order to relay information in different, clear and fast ways to the audience.
Main features
![Visualizations](visualisation.png)
- Heat map with tooltip and when hovering information in separate box (See heatmap)
- Bar chart with enlargement effect
- Zoomable sunburst diagram with enlargement effect
- ----
- Dropdown sort by state, sort by type of disorder
- Tooltip with extra information
- Enlargement while hovering

## The minimum viable product (MVP)
-	Heat map with tooltip and when hovering information in separate box (See heatmap)
-	Bar chart with enlargement effect
-	Zoomable sunburst diagram with enlargement effect
-	Dropdown sort by type of disorder
-	Tooltip with extra information

## Optional to implement.
- ----
- Perhaps working with all 4 datasets may be optional I may just choose 2 to start
- Enlargement while hovering
- Dropdown sort by state

## Prerequisites
Describe the things that you’ll have to get in order.
List the data sources that you will use and whether you will need to transform the data before it is usable for your application. The list should include links to where the data sources can be downloaded or accessed.
### Data sources
[Thoughts of suicide] (https://data.world/samhsa/serious-thoughts-of-suicide)
[Major depressive episode (https://data.world/samhsa/major-depressive-episode)
[Serious mental illness] (https://data.world/samhsa/serious-mental-illness)
[Any mental illness] (https://data.world/samhsa/any-mental-illness)

### External components
List the external components (libraries like d3-tip or SQLite) that you need to implement certain features. Include the names, and if the component is not standard, include a link to its website.

### Previous implementation
Include a review of similar mobile apps or related visualizations, in terms of features and technical aspects: what do they do? how have they implemented it? can you do it in the same way?

My website I find to be most similar to this website. The use of 4 visualizations. Including a heat map and 2 bar charts. This website also allows the possibility to sort by country (which would be sort by state in my case)

### Challenges
Identify the hardest parts of implementing your application: think of technical problems or limitations that could arise during development and what possibilities you have to overcome these.
Combining the data and I think the zoomable sunburst diagram.

Note explain more what happens during the sort by state (and or type)
