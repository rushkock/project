            This text is temporary.
            This is a website which can help visualize mental health. However, it is dataset specific.
            It only shows suicide rates. Suicide is not classified as a mental disorder, it is a symptom of mental disorder.
            This can be seen as a pro because in different countries, there are different definitions of mental health.
            Suicide has a more general and accepted definition regardless of circumstances.
            However, that may also mean that in different countries there are different circumstances that drive someone to commit suicide.
            An example of this is that in countries where firearms are legal, people may accidentally commit suicide,
            this doesn't say anything about their mental health.</p>
