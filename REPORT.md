### Challenges
Biggest challenge while making this assignment turned out to be linking the visualizations and filtering them. It took me a whole week to filter it. While fixing one problem 2 more seemed to pop out. Moreover, writing efficient code was also a struggle.
Furthermore, the design decisions I had to make were harder than I thought. View process book for more information.
